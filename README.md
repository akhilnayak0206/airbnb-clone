This website was made with the help of lewagon-coding bootcamp.

To start making this website first we need to create-react-app airbnb-clone. /*You can use any name instead of airbnb-clone*/
Make sure that you have npm or yarn installed in the PC.
Then run npm start or yarn start.
You can also clone this project and then run npm start.

Make sure to install google-map-react for map.
To install google map type: npm install google-map-react.

You can also use any other map if you want.

For filtering through the flats in search box RegEx is used for making it non case-sensitive and exec for string matching is used.

Marker is made with the help of css and a different react class is made for it.

This is my first React Website so if you have any suggestion or doubt do let me know.
Thank You.
